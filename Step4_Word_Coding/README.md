START
INITIALISE SYSTEM CLOCK
INPUT FEEDING_TIME, MAXIMUM_BOWL_WEIGHT, MINIMUM_BOWL_WEIGHT, MAX_CONSUMPTION_TIME

IF SYSTEM_TIME = FEEDING_TIME THEN:
    SET IS_FEEDING_TIME TO TRUE
    IF FOOD_STOCK_PRESENT :
       ROTATE THE MOTOR AND DISPENSE FOOD
       CHECK THE WEIGHT OF THE BOWL
       IF WEIGHT OF THE BOWL IS NOT INCREASING:
            ALERT "FOOD NOT DISPENSED"
       ELSE(IF WEIGHT INCREASING):
            CHECK THE WEIGHT OF THE BOWL
            IF WEIGHT OF BOWL IS EQUAL TO THE MAXIMUM_BOWL_WEIGHT:
                STOP FOOD DISPENSING BY SETTING IS_FEEDING_TIME FALSE
    ELSE (IF NOT FOOD_STOCK_PRESENT) :
        SEND ALERT MESSAGE "FOOD NOT PRESENT IN STOCK" AND TURN ON RED LED WITH ALARM 
ELSE(IF NOT SYSTEM_TIME= FEEDING_TIME):
    WAIT FOR FEEDING TIME

MONITOR THE WEIGHT OF THE BOWL
IF WEIGHT OF THE BOWL IS SAME WHEN MAX_CONSUMPTION_TIME:
    ALERT "FOOD IS NOT EATEN" WITH RED LED AND ALARM
    WAIT FOR AN HOUR FOR THE FOOD TO BE CONSUMED AND CHECK THE WEIGHT OF THE BOWL
ELSE(IF WEIGHT IS NOT THE SAME):
    CHECK THE WEIGHT OF THE BOWL
    IF WEIGHT OF THE BOWL IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM WEIGHT SET:
        ALERT "FOOD COMPLETELY EATEN"
    ELSE(IF THE WEIGHT IS NOT EQUAL TO MINIMUM WEIGHT):
        ALERT "FOOD PARTIALLY EATEN"

LOOP TO START AND CHECK THE SYSTEM TIME AND WAIT FOR FEEDING TIME
